            We understand that weddings can be expensive to attend, especially for our guests traveling
            from out of town, so please feel no obligation to get us anything.
            If you do decide to get us a gift, we have a small registry and have set up a fund where you can contribute
            to the down payment we've been saving for our first house.  All of this can be found
            <a href="https://registry.theknot.com/john-jardel-katharine-heffner-april-2019-tx/30548524">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best gift of all would be your presence on our big day!
