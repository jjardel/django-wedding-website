                If you've never been to Austin before, don't expect to see cowboys and horses.  Do expect to enjoy
                some of the best food and drinks you've ever had.  April is kind of a transition month between
                warm and hot, with average highs in the 80s-90s and lows in the 50s-60s.

            <h3>Getting Here</h3>
            <p>
                If you're coming from Philadelphia, American Airlines offers 2 non-stop flights a day to Austin.
                Those coming from Newark will find frequent non-stops on United and Southwest.  Both Uber and Lyft serve
                Austin, and if you're staying somewhere near downtown, you could get around pretty easily with ridesharing.
                If you do decide to rent a car, all the major rental companies are available at the airport.

            <h3>Things to Do</h3>
            <p>Hey!  Did you know that Austin is basically the coolest place ever?  Well, we think so and we
                have...extensive experience with all of the fun things to do.  Here are some of our favorite recommendations:
            </p>
            <h4>BBQ</h4>
            <p>
                You can't come all the way to Texas and not try some BBQ.  We recommend
                <a href="http://terryblacksbbq.com/">Terry Black's</a>, but won't stop you if you want to wait in the
                famous 5-hour line at <a href="https://franklinbbq.com/">Franklin</a>.
                Eat like a local and ask for "fatty brisket".  Be sure to leave the sauce on the side!
            </p>
            <h4>Tex-Mex</h4>
            <p>
                Lucky for you, we consider ourselves taco aficionados and are very opinionated about the subject.
                Here are some of our favorite taco suggestions:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.tacodeli.com/">Tacodeli</a> - with locations all over town, there's no
                    excuse to leave without hitting up tacodeli for at least one meal.  Good for both lunch and
                    breakfast tacos (yes, that's a thing).
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://torchystacos.com/">Torchy's</a> - another Austin classic with lots of locations.
                        Our favorite taco is the Trailer Park (make sure to get it "trashy"), and their queso
                        is the best in town.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.veracruzallnatural.com/">Veracruz All Natural</a> - this might be our new
                        favorite taco joint.  Try the Migas taco, it'll change your life.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're looking for heartier fare, all of the following restaurants are great for dinner:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.trudys.com/index.php">Trudy's</a> - you can't get much more Austin than
                        Trudy's.  Treat yourself to a Mexican Martini (careful, they're strong!) and try the stuffed
                        avocado.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.lacondesa.com/">La Condesa</a> - for a bit more formal of a dinner, check
                        out La Condesa (especially if you're staying near downtown).  Their craft cocktails are excellent,
                        and small plates are great for sharing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.currasgrill.com/">Curra's</a> - if you're staying near the Wildflower Center,
                        this is a great place for dinner.  Like avocado?  Like margaritas?  Why not combine the two with one
                        of their signature avocado margaritas?
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Other Great Restuarants</h4>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Beer</h4>
            <p>
                There are more breweries per capita in Austin than any place outside of Bavaria.  Ok, we made that up
                but there are lots of great options for those that want to experience the best of our local craft
                beer scene.
                <ul>

                    <li>
                        <a href="http://liveoakbrewing.com/">Live Oak Brewing</a> - if you want to start the trip off
                        right, pop in to Live Oak on your way home from the airport.  Their Hefeweizen is Katharine's favorite beer ever.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://theabgb.com/">ABGB</a> - short for Austin Beer Garden & Brewery, ABGB has something
                        for everyone.  They brew their own beers, and they have all the local hits on tap.  Plus, there's
                        a great selection of food.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.lazarusbrewing.com">Lazarus</a> - if you're planning a trip to the hip Eastside,
                        make sure to put Lazarus on your list of places to stop for a beer.  They have a great outdoor space, and the
                        beers are strong and hoppy.  If that's not your thing, it's a short
                        walk to <a href="http://www.zilkerbeer.com/">Zilker Brewing Company</a>,
                        <a href="http://www.hopsandgrain.com/">Hops & Grain</a>, and <a href="http://blueowlbrewing.com/">Blue Owl</a>
                        (all great options).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="http://www.oasistexasbrewingcompany.com/">Oasis Brewing</a> - if you're renting a car and would
                        like to drink a beer at one of the best places to watch a sunset in Austin, you should consider heading
                        over to Oasis Brewing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://jesterkingbrewery.com/">Jester King</a> - this one also requires a car, but if you're a beer nerd you
                        owe it to yourself to make a pilgrimage here.
                        Jester King is on a farm about half an hour outside the city.  What makes them unique is they brew all their
                        beer with wild yeast, which gives all their beers a funky sour edge.  It's probably the most unique brewery
                        in the world.
